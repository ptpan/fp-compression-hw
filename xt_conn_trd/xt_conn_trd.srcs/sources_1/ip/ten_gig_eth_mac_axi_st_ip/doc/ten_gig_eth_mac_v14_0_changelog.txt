2014.3:
 * Version 14.0
 * Added new 32-Bit datapath option for the core to provide lower utilization and latency
 * MDIO Ready is now returned in both the MDIO read data register and the MDIO control register
 * Updated Statistics to correctly return an AXI slave transaction error (SLVERR) when a write access is attempted
 * Updated Statistics counters to prevent TX frames smaller than 64 bytes being counted in the 64 byte frame counter
 * Added a reset synchronizer to the AXI4-Lite reset (s_axi_aresetn) to synchronize it onto the AXI4-Lite clock (s_axi_aclk); this now allows the reset to be driven asynchronously to s_axi_aclk, matching the Product Guide description.
 * Fix for corner case where an oversized VLAN frame of size 1524 bytes would be incorrectly transmitted without XGMII error codes when the TX configuration is as follows: Jumbo frames and MTU disabled; VLAN enabled; In-band FCS enabled.
 * Updated example design Transmit FIFO to ensure that the FIFO will not hang when frame sizes larger than the FIFO memory size are sent for transmission.
 * Updated example design to add a new pattern generator and checker
 * Updated example design to add a new configuration vector/AXI4-Lite control state machine
 * Updated demonstration testbench to add BIST mode support
 * Input port default tie-off values for IP Integrator have been corrected (to be logic 1) for tx_axis_aresetn, rx_axis_aresetn, tx_dcm_locked and rx_dcm_locked
 * For VHDL projects, the top level VHDL file for the core is now compiled into the default library (named xil_defaultlib unless overridden by the user).  All other core VHDL source remains in the core specific library (ten_gig_eth_mac_v14_0 for this core version).  This makes the core consistent with other Xilinx IP.
 * Added support for Zync-7000 and 7-Series Defense-grade parts

2014.2:
 * Version 13.1 (Rev. 1)
 * Fix for corner case usage of Priority Flow Control on transmit when Oneshot and XON/XOFF are mixed on the same priority.

2014.1:
 * Version 13.1
 * Virtex UltraScale Pre-Production support.
 * Added an option for support of Priority Based Flow Control.
 * Reduced the transmitter data path latency by 57.6 ns.  This is achieved via a new CRC engine architecture.
 * Updated Statistics to correctly differentiate between small and fragment frames (AR 59308).
 * Updated TX Statistics vector to correctly indicate frame size for oversize frames.
 * Fix for corner case incorrect rx statistics vector bit 27 when runt frame received.
 * Fix for corner case illegal Control characters before the Start code of a transmitted frame
 * Fix for corner case illegal IFG before the Start code of a transmitted frame.
 * Fix for corner case TX frame error due to previous frame being close to the maximum frame size.
 * Ensured Custom Preamble enable is correctly reset.
 * Added missing XDC constraints on the MDIO signal inputs to ease timing closure (AR 59891).
 * Netlists created by write_verilog and write_vhdl are IEEE P1735 encrypted, with keys for supported simulators so that netlist simulation can still be done
 * Enable third party synthesis tools to read encrypted netlists (but not source HDL)
 * Enhanced the example design demonstration testbench with a CRC engine. Frames of any size or content can now be generated to stimulate the core.
 * Removed an unused HDL source file from the core (synchronizer_e.vhd).
 * Added serialization logic on the tx_statistics_vector and rx_statistics_vector outputs in the example design to reduce the pinout.
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes

2013.4:
 * Version 13.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Tidied up XDC syntax to use more specific endpoints for some constraints.
 * Unencrypted core source files are now delivered into the correct library.
 * Out-of-context XDC file now delivered into synth subdirectory.
 * Version register now returns the correct value.
 * Kintex UltraScale Pre-Production support

2013.3:
 * Version 13.0
 * Supported Artix-7 parts moved to production.
 * XDC now delivered with simulation-only license.
 * Replaced MMCM_BASE primitives with 7-series native MMCM2_BASE primitives.
 * Added a default case to next state decoding in AXI-Lite slave attachment block.
 * Use inferred rather than instanced block RAM in the FIFO in the example design.
 * Change parameters to upper case in example design FIFO files.
 * Remove BUFG from feedback path in transmit MMCM
 * Added GUI option to include or exclude shareable logic resources in the core. Please refer to the Product Guide for information and port changes.
 * Added missing -datapath_only switch to some clock-crossing paths inside the core.
 * Added missing begin/end to Verilog example design address swap block
 * Removed the C_BASE_ADDRESS RTL parameter and shrunk AXI4-Lite address bus from 32 bits to 11 bits; address decoding for upper bits is done in AXI-Interconnect core now.
 * Updated synchronizers for clock domain crossing to reduce Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) from metastability.
 * Added support for Cadence IES and Synopsys VCS simulators.
 * Added support for IP Integrator.

2013.2:
 * Version 12.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Virtex-7, Kintex-7 and Zynq-7000 parts moved to production.
 * VHDL example design - correct wiring of tx_dcm_locked input to physical interface block in example design.
 * Transmitter now only transmits legal control characters when erroring a frame.
 * Constraints processing order changed.

2013.1:
 * Version 12.0
 * Add support for Zynq xc7z030, xc7z045 and xc7z100 parts.
 * Changed core hierarchy so that what was previously the "block" level is now the core top level.
 * Add an XDC file scoped to the core level.
 * Receive Out Of bounds frames were not being counted in statistics if followed immediately by another frame.
 * Core XDC constraints file now uses set_max_delay for some internal paths instead of set_false_path.
 * Added IP-XACT bus definitions for AXI4-Stream, AXI4-Lite, MDIO and XGMII interfaces.
 * Removed unnecessary 'VCC', 'GND' signals from the example design files 
 * tx_axis_tuser has changed from a single bit to a vector.
 * Fixed behavioural simulation of example design.
 * Fix for receiver marking 12 byte frame as good.
 * Fix for transmitter hang when sending a 63 byte frame with inband FCS passing.
 * Fix for minimum IFG following an errored frame.
 * Remove redundant register on tx_dcm_locked and rx_dcm_locked.
 * Tidy up unused signals.
 * Improve reliability after powerup that occasionally caused first frame transmitted to have the incorrect FCS.
 * Improve synchronization of AXI FIFO pointers across clock domains.
 * Added support for the out-of-context flow.
