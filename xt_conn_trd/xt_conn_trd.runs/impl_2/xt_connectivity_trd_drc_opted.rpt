2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PORTPROP-2#1 Warning
selectio_diff_term  
The port clk_ref_n has an invalid DIFF_TERM property value. For the target architecture, IOSTANDARD value DIFF_SSTL15 does not support on-chip input differential termination. The DIFF_TERM property value will be ignored.
Related violations: <none>
